This delivery is structured by folders as follows:
- Folder "data" : contains the datasets used in the project
- Folder "doc"  : contains the document explaining all the work done in this project
- Folder "lib"  : contains the code used created by other colleagues in the first delivery
- Folder "scripts": contains the main code file called "main.py", as well as the output datafile with our queries solved "OutFile.xml"

Prerequisites:
In order to execute the full code, the package "SPARQLWRAPPER" must be installed. If when the main executes the only option to execute is
the one that refers to calculating the results by checking the OutFile and the Train dataset, it is not necessary.
